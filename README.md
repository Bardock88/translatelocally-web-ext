# bergamot-translations
Bergamot Translations is a webextension that enables client side in-page translations for web browsers.

Bergamot Translations is a fork of [Firefox Translations](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-translations) to experiment with an unprivileged translation plugin for browsers, and serve as a test platform for [bergamot-translator](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator). It misses many of the features Firefox Translations has.
